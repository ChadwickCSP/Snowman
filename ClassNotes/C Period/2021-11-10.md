## What is a Class

C# is an Object Oriented Programming language. This is often abbreviated as OOP.
At a high level this means that when we program in C# we try to manage
complexity by abstracting our ideas into data called "objects". For example, if
you created a simulation of Chadwick's School, you might have building objects,
student objects, and teacher objects.

Each of these types of objects would have their own set of properties:

* What properties would a building have?
* What properties would a student have?
* What properties would a teacher have?

In OOP, we call a set of properties that objects share a "class" which is short
for classification.

### Building Class Example

There is an example file in the `ChadwickSimulation` directory at the root of
this project. The initial version of this class is below:

```csharp
namespace ChadwickSimulation
{
    /// <summary>
    /// A building has a name and capacity.
    /// </summary>
    public class Building
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// The name of this building.
        /// </summary>
        public string name;

        /// <summary>
        /// The number of people this building can hold. 
        /// </summary>
        public int capacity;

        /// <summary>
        /// Initializes an instance of a Building specifying its name and capacity.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="name">The name of the building.</param>
        /// <param name="capacity">The capacity of the building.</param>
        public Building(string name, int capacity)
        {
            this.name = name;
            this.capacity = capacity;
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets information about this building.
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns>A string with information about this building.</returns>
        public string GetInfo()
        {
            return $"{this.name} has a capacity of {this.capacity}.";
        }

    }
}
```

## What is an Interface

An interface allows us to define a set of methods that we want to have without providing
an implementation.

For example, the interface for a car is relatively universal. If you know how to drive
one car, you can, for the most part, figure out how to drive any car.

### Car Interface Example

There is an example of a Car interface in the `CarExample` directory at the root of this project.

```csharp
namespace CarExample
{

    /// <summary>
    /// Defines a set of methods common for Cars.
    /// </summary>
    public interface ICar
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Turns this Car's key.
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns>true if the Car is running and false otherwise.</returns>
        bool TurnKey();

        /// <summary>
        /// Returns the maximum speed of this Car in miles per hour.
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns>The max speed.</returns>
        int GetMaxSpeed();

        /// <summary>
        /// Returns the current speed of this Car in miles per hour.
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns>The current speed.</returns>
        int GetSpeed();

        /// <summary>
        /// Attempts to accelerate the car.
        /// </summary>
        void Accelerate();

        /// <summary>
        /// Attempts to brake the car.
        /// </summary>
        void Brake();
    }

}
```
